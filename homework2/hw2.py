# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
#The command that allows you to go directly to ~/Desktop would be "cd /Desktop" or "cd ~"

# 2) What does ~/ mean?
# ~/ means the directory listed after it is the Home Directory.

# 3) What's the difference between an abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
#An absolute path is the name of the full path all the way from the system root, while a relative path gives the path relative to the current working directory.

# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
#The cd ~ command.

# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do? 
#The terminal would respond "rm: "." and ".." may not be removed", to protect the directories you're in from being removed.

# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
#git add moves your files from your working directory to a "staging area", and git commit moves the files from the staging area to your local repository, and git push moves the files from your local repository to your remote repository on GitHub.

# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
#The message "On branch main, Changes to be committed: (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage) new file:   file_name" would appear, and it is telling you a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next commit.

# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
#The most frustrating error so far actually happened during the first day, during installation of Git. I was trying to get Homebrew installed (so literally the first step) and I kept getting error after error. I troubleshooted it/resolved it by just thinking about why this could be happening for awhile, and I had a distant memory of using Homebrew for something in another class years ago, and the problem was that Homebrew was already installed on my computer. I think the troubleshooting method I used in this case was instead of trying again and again without any deep thinking, I should take a step back and think of other reasons the error might be happening. Besides that, I have been pretty lucky and haven't encountered any other major errors.

# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
#Pulling from a repository allows someone to get the latest changes and files to a remote repository on GitHub. Cloning a repository is different in that you end up with a local copy of a remote repository, and you don't have permission to push changes to the remote repository. They also differ in that cloning gives you a copy of all the files in the repository while pulling only gives you copies of the files where changes have been made.

# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
# My fun fact is that scientists can tell the color of certain dinosaurs by looking at the ways in which light would've reflected off of their fossilized pigment :)
